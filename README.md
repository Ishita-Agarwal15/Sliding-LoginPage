### BONUS: More About Environment Variables
- A `.env` file is used to store configuration settings like API keys, database credentials, etc for an application.
- `.env` files should be added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being committed to your version control system. 
- To generate a secure unique SECRET_KEY in Python:
    
  Option 1: Quick and Easy (for development only)
  ```
  import os
  app.secret_key=os.urandom(24)
  ```
  Option 2: Use a strong fixed key (recommended for production)
  ```
  # if using, run this in the command prompt

  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))"
  ```
- To use `.env` in Flask
  
  1. Install `python-dotenv`: this allows flask to load variables from `.env` file
     ```
     pip install python-dotenv
     ```
  2. Create file named as `.env` and write you SECRET_KEY
  3. Update `app.py` to load `.env`
     ```
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     import os

     #load environment variables from .env file
     load_dotenv()    
     
     #set your secret key
     app.secret_key=os.getenv("SECRET_KEY)
     ```
